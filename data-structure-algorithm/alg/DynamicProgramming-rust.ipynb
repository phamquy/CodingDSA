    "Dynamic Programming is about solving complex problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem once, and reusing those solutions. The two classic strategies are:\n",
    "- Top-down (memoization): recursion + cache\n",
    "- Bottom-up (tabulation): iterative DP table\n",
