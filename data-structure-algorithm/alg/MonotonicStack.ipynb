    "## 1. Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A monotonic stack keeps elements (usually indices) so their corresponding values are strictly increasing or decreasing.\n",
    "Each element is pushed and popped at most once → O(n) total.\n",
    "You pop when the incoming element violates the monotonic invariant, resolving queries for popped items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why indices? They let you compute distances (spans, widths) and re-access values. Each time element pop from stack, it will make a contribution to the final result:\n",
    "\n",
    "What Contribution Means: Each element in the array can “contribute” to the answer over a certain range defined by:\n",
    "- The next greater/smaller element to the left\n",
    "- The next greater/smaller element to the right\n",
    "- The stack helps identify these bounds efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind is that the monotonic stack actually help to track the **next** smaller or greater on the both left and right side, for example if increasing monotonic stack:\n",
    "- Stack itself keep track of closet previous smaller element on the left\n",
    "- While travel a list, when find a element that smaller than stack head, then it the next smaller element on the right of head of stack, so keep poping stack and compare stack head with current value will tell if current element is the next smaller of next greater\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the following array \n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "0 o\n",
    "1 oo\n",
    "2 oooo\n",
    "3 oooooo\n",
    "4 oooooooo\n",
    "5 ooooo\n",
    "6 oooo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From 0 to 4, the value increaseing so each element is the next greater on the right (below). Upon encounter value at index 5:\n",
    "- val(5) smaller than value at val(4), then 5 is index of next smaller than value at 4 on the right, pop 4 from stack. Stack head is 3\n",
    "- val(5) smaller val(3), pop 3 from stack, stack head is 2\n",
    "- val(5) greater than val(2), so 5 is index of next GREATER than value at 2, add to stack, stack head is 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variant:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack with constraint on size, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- monotonic window with size --> fix size monotonic stack\n",
    "- monotonic window with size at most k\n",
    "\n",
    "Push element back to stack after pop (asteroid collision example), this example also demostrate case where the comparison not only on the value but also the sign of the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, monotinic stack tracking next smaller or greater on the both side of the stack head (and stack head change as we push or pop)  \n"

    "## 2. Thought process and pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Common pattern to use monotonic stack is where a solution, and part of solution depend on the surrounding value of current element being examined. \n",
    "For example, to find next greater element, the condition we need to check for surrounding is if it greater than current value; or in finding lagest rectangle, then the condition is finding element expanding from current element to meet condition that current element to be the smallest...\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you still need to be able to regconize the problem in order to reasoning and deduce what condition of surrounding element we need to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it's recognized, then we need to identify what kind of monotonic stack to used (smaller, greater...). The general guide is that when examine an value and compare agains the stack, the condition to add to stack should be in opposite to condition that we looking for to form a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- To find next greater element, then we want to use smaller/decrease stack,\n",
    "- To find the largest rectangle in historgram, where we need to expand the width to the element that before the next smaller (on the left and right) then we need to use greater/increase stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution, or part of solution can be found at the time of poping element from stack, but sometime it can not (e.g in the problem to find min of contiguous sub-array). In the case it can not, we normally need to 2 passes.\n"

    "- The first time we see a value greater than nums[j], it must be the closest greater to the right (because every element between j and current index i was processed and was <= nums[j], otherwise j would have been popped earlier). After popping j we never revisit it. \n",

    "### Trapping Rain Water (Stack Version)\n",
    "**Problem Statement:** Given non-negative integer heights representing elevation map bars (width 1), compute how much water can be trapped after raining.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** Use a stack of indices of non-decreasing heights. When a higher bar appears, it may form a container with a previous higher (left) boundary. Pop the middle bar as the “bottom” and compute water = width * (min(left_height, right_height) - bottom_height).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it Works:** Water trapped above a bar depends on the nearest higher (or equal) bars on both sides. The monotonic increase ensures that when a taller right bar arrives, all lower bars between it and a taller (or equal) left boundary can have their trapped water resolved exactly once. Each index is pushed/popped at most once.\n",
